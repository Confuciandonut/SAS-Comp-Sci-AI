"Club Fair" folder refers to some old work done for a club fair prototype. Might be interesting for some of you.

"Runs" folder (in the ProjectFull folder) refers to all of the trained models in chronological order.

The various scripts in the "Functions" folder do the following:
- Run_Model takes a pytorch model and runs it real time using the computer camera.
- Frame_Splitter takes a .mp4 file and converts it into images.
